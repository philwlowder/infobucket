My earliest memory is chewing on the rungs of my crib.
Gnawing the wood hurt so good and the taste was pleasing.
I wonder if lead paint was involved. If so, that might explain a lot.

Another early memory I have is my father holding me while he stood beside our refrigerator. He held me against his chest with one arm under me. My face was close to his. I don't remember my mother being nearby. He laughingly asked "Who do you like best, your mother or me?". I had to think about the answer to that question.

With more experience I could have replied, "I like you best! How about some ice cream?". 

I didn't like it. I eventually replied to him, "I like you both".

One spring when I was young, my grandfather and uncle took me fishing up the Uhwarrie River.  We started at Morrow Mountain State Park. I only have two memories of that day.

I remember my uncle dragging the boat over a shallow area. In my mind's eye I still see him, but today he is just a moving silhouette, the with water up to his knees.
My grandfather and I watch from shore.

As they fished, I remember sitting in the middle of the boat. The boat was parallel to shore. I watched as rain came down. They fish hitting their lures as fast as they could make another cast. I watched from under something that today seems like a tarp draped over me. It was as if I were looking out from a cave. They caught white bass in the pouring rain.

My last fishing trip with my grandfather was on Badin Lake.
We trolled for striped bass. We each caught a fish that day. Mine was 5 lbs and his was
3 lbs if I remember correctly. I must have been about 23, never the less when my
fish was hooked he reached for my rod as if I were three. I kept the rod in my hands.

In the late 1950s and into the 1960s, my mother's father kept his homemade boat at
Morrow Mountain State Park.
His was not the only boat chained to trees on the bank.
The boats floated where the foot bridge now lands at its boat launch side.

He loaded his motor, fishing rods, fuel and other gear. Then he drove from Badin to the park using Falls road. Before reaching Falls Reservoir he turned to the right on a road that
took him into the park. When this road ended, he turned right again and soon came to the park gate.

Most often there was rain water in the bottom of the boat.
To remove the water, he used a gallon Preston Anti Freeze can. Its top removed
and a copper handle welded to it. I can remember the sound of the can made as it ran along the bottom of the wooden boat. He walked the motor to the stern and attached it.
When everything was loaded he started the motor by pulling its cord.
I can still smell the gas and oil floating in the air.

I would guess he was 73 and I was 21 when I made this trip for the last time.
I thought he was old, but I was impressed he walked the motor to the back of
the floating boat. I wasn't sure I could keep my balance with the load and moving boat.

My last memory of that day is nearing Falls Dam. We were heading into current and aimed at a large rock. My concern changed to alarm when he gave the motor a quick burst of gas. The bow of the boat lifted out of the water and the boat slid onto the rock.
I was glad I remained outwardly calm and he could not see my face. Safely on the rock,
I remembered this maneuver from past fishing trips.
