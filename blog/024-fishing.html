        <h1>Fishing Memories</h1>
        <h3>on Stanly County and Montgomery County water</h3>

      <p class="post">posted - October 28th, 2020</p>

      <hr>

<p class="paragraph"> My earliest memory is chewing on the rungs of my
crib. It was an itch I had to scratch. My jaws pressed my gums to bite
and gnaw with as much pressure as I could stand. Then I would go back
for more. I wonder if lead paint was involved. If so, that might
explain a lot. </p>

<p class="paragraph"> Another early memory I have is my father holding
me while he stood beside our refrigerator. He held me against his chest
with one arm under me. My face was close to his. I don't remember my
mother being nearby. He laughingly asked "Who do you like best, your
mother or me?". I had to think about the answer to that question. It
felt uncomfortable. </p>

<p class="paragraph"> One spring when I was a boy, my grandfather and
uncle took me fishing up the Uwharrie River. We started at Morrow
Mountain State Park. I only have two memories of that day. I remember
my uncle dragging the boat over a shallow area. In my mind's eye I
still see him, but today he is just a moving silhouette, with water up
to his knees. My grandfather and I were watching from shore. </p>

<p class="paragraph"> The boat was anchored below swift water and
parallel to shore. I remember sitting in the middle of the boat as they
fished. They caught white bass in the pouring spring rain. The fish
were hitting their lures as fast as they could cast. I watched from
under cover as if I were looking out of a cave. </p>

<p class="paragraph"> In the late 1950s and into the 1960s, my mother's
father kept a homemade boat at Morrow Mountain State Park. His was
not the only boat chained to trees on the bank. The boats floated where
the foot bridge now lands on its boat launch side. </p>
 
<p class="paragraph"> He loaded his motor, fishing rods, fuel and other
gear. He then drove from Ash to Pine to Stanly and down Falls until
turning right onto a road that made it's way into the park. Then he
turned uphill and to the park entrance. Some mornings he would wait for
a ranger to open the entrance gate. </p>

<p class="paragraph"> Most often there was rain water in the bottom of
the boat. To remove the water, he used a gallon Preston Anti Freeze
can. Its top was removed and a copper handle welded to its side. I can
remember the sound of the can made as it ran along the bottom of the
wooden boat. He walked the motor to the stern and attached it. When
everything was loaded he started the motor by pulling its cord. I can
still smell the gas and oil floating in the air. </p>

<p class="paragraph"> I'm now about his age when we made that trip for
the last time. I thought he was old. I was impressed he walked the
motor to the back of the boat. I wasn't sure I could keep my balance
carrying the load in a floating boat. </p>

<p class="paragraph"> My last memory of that day was nearing Falls Dam.
We were heading into current with the boat aimed at a large rock. My
concern changed to alarm when he gave the motor gas. The boat lurched
forward the bow lifting and sliding onto a rock. I was glad I remained
outwardly calm and he could not see my face. Safely on the rock, I
remembered this maneuver from past fishing trips when I was younger.
</p>

<p class="paragraph"> My last fishing trip with my grandfather was on
Badin Lake. We trolled for striped bass. We each caught a fish that
day. I was 23. When my fish was hooked, he reached toward me to take
the rod as if I were three. </p>
