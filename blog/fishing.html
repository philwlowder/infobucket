I. Earliest memory

Older memories are incomplete fragments of events.

My earliest memory is chewing on the rungs of my crib.
Gnawing the wood hurt so good and the taste was pleasing.
I wonder if the painted rungs contained lead.
If so, that might explain a lot.


I remember my father was holding me while he stood beside our refrigerator.
He held me against his chest with one arm under me. My face was close to his.
I don't remember my mother being near. He laughingly asked "Who do you like best,
your mother or me?" I thought about the answer to that question.

With more experience I could have replied, "I like you best! How about some ice cream?".
Or I might have replied "I like mom best, but if you give me some ice cream I'm willing to think it over."
I remember thinking if I choose one, the other will not be happy.
That direction seemed cruel and risky.
It was the first dilemma involving relationships I remember.
I didn't like it. I eventually replied "I like you both.".

In the late 1950s and into the 1960s, my mother's father kept a homemade boat at MMSP.
I don't know how that worked. His was not the only private boat in the water. They were
tied up with chains around trees next to the water. The boats floated where the
footbridge starts on the boat launch. He would load his motor, fishing rods and fuel and drive
into the park and down to the river.

Used a Preston Ant-Freeze can with a welded handle,
Handle looked like cooper.
Drove boat onto rock.
