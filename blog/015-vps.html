         <h1>Virtual Private Server</h1>
         <p>January 18th, 2020</p>

         <br> I am now hosting my website with an affordable Virtual Private
         Server (VPS) from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/">Amazon
            Web Services (AWS) Lightsail</a>. </br>

         <br>
         Most small, low traffic sites are served from shared hosting accounts.
         There are advantages to having my own server.
         With AWS Lightsail, one advantage is lower cost.
         Another advantage is performance.
         Testing my new server with <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPageTest</a>
         I have seen an increase in my "page speed".
         Now I have the ability to work directly with the server software, Apache.
         </br>

         <br>
         Amazon calls each virtual server an "instance". I started my first AWS instance
         December 31st, 2019.
         With <a href="https://bitnami.com/">Bitnami</a> as a partner,
         AWS offers a variety of software installations.
         I first tried the Bitnami LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP).
         My virtual server instance was created almost instantly.
         My operating system of choice was Ubuntu 18.4 "Bionic" with Apache version 2.4.
         Picking the most recent versions seemed to make sense.
         </br>

         <br> I had experience with <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WAMP</a> (Windows, Apache, Mysql,
         PHP). I installed WAMP on my desktop PC several years ago. WAMP makes
         it possible to develop websites on my own desktop PC using <a href="https://www.html.net/">PHP</a>. </br>

         <br> Once the AWS VPS was created, I began to explore. Looking at
         Apache 2.4 configuration files, I became confused. I didn't recognize
         them. I decided to delete the first instance and start over. I created
         the second instance without Bitnami's help. I wanted to make certain
         that Bitnami could not be a part of my confusion. </br>

         <br> Once again I chose Ubuntu 18 "Bionic" for an operating system.
         Next I manually installed Apache 2.4. I began to realized this new
         version of Apache used a different configuration system. That was the
         main source of my confusion. I began to make progress, but 90% of the
         help found on the internet was for older versions of Apache. My past
         knowledge was as confusing as it was helpful. </br>

         <br> After some study, I had Apache configured and my website up and
         running. The next step was to install a <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> certificate. I
         misread the instructions but the certificate appeared to install
         correctly. Even though the installation looked correct, an error
         message popped up. After more work and reading, I suspected a firewall
         issue. I spent a long time working with Apache and it's firewall
         looking for a solution. After much head banging, I dimly recalled
         firewall settings in the Lightsail management pages. Once I found that
         page again and made the correct adjustments my problem was solved.
         </br>

         <br> Next <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">Mysql</a> installed without
         any trouble. Then I installed <a href="https://www.htmlmyadmin.net/">Phpmyadmin</a> and an error
         message told me I had a missing PHP module. After another long
         struggle, I solved that problem. I learned something basic. The PHP
         used by Apache and Ubuntu are separate. Mine were different versions
         and I had assumed they were the same. </br>

         <br> When I began, I selected the $3.50 instance. After installing the
         above apps, I had used 20% of the drive space and 75% of the ram
         memory. </br>

         <br> I haven't loaded a table into the database yet. There was only
         one page that needed a database and I temporarily removed it from the
         menu. </br>

         <br> I'm happy with the result. I doubt I have optimized this
         instance, but the site works well and is fast. </br>
