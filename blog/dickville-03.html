            <p class="tab">first published 12-01-09, with serveral edits later</p>

            <p class="paragraph">
               Before 1930 there were many one room school houses in Stanly County. One
               was the Dickville school serving the area that is now Morrow Mountain
               State Park. I've been collecting information and thinking about this one room
               school for 15 years.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
               I've heard some people say the school was on the right side of
               Morrow Mountain road and just before entering current park gate. I think this
               is where the Dick family lived, and at some point in time the school may
               have been there.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
               But that location outside today's park gate does not match information
               from two maps of the early 1900s. One map is the <a
                  href="http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/ncmaps/id/266" class="link">Miller Map</a>
               of about 1909. This <a href="/blog/media/1910millermap-section.jpg" class="link">section</a> of
               that 1909 map shows the area of interest.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
               The other map is a 1920
               <a href="http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/ncmaps/id/939" class="link">Rural Delivery
                  Map</a>.
               This <a href="/blog/media/1920-ruraldelivery-map.jpg" class="link">section</a>
               of the map shows the area of interest. The school symbol is included in the
               <a href="/blog/media/po-legend.jpg" class="link">legend</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
               Both maps indicate the school sat inside what is now the park boundary.
               Both maps show the school sitting on the south side of the old ferry road.
               In general the road followed the path of the old wagon road.
               The school appears near the turn toward Ebenezer Church and by 1917 the town of Badin.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
               On December 7th, 2007 a video was made of Richard Walter Mills touring
               the park with Ranger Ron Anundson. Mr. Mills attended the Dickville
               School. Mr. Mills indicated the school site was on the south side of the
               old ferry road near the turn toward Badin. He recalled a spring that
               the children drank from. Mr. Mills also mentions a church on the north side
               of the ferry road.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
               The pond was built by the CCC to supply water to the swimming pool. I believe
               the location for the pond was chosen in part because of the spring used by the school.


               Here is a photo of the students.

            <h4>Added - October 23rd, 2016 </h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
               Some reports indicate the Dickville School sat across the old Ferry Road from the
               junction with the road/path from Badin.
               It is important to remember that the road from Badin has evolved over time.
               There have been at least two branches of the road coming from Badin.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
               During the early history of the area the road/path seems to have joined the Ferry road farther east
               (nearer the river) than it does today. I think this was the case until sometime prior to 1920.
               The eastern branch would have been the wagon road that Dr. Kron and others
               took from the Ferry Road on their travels north toward Badin.
               On the
               <a href="http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/ncmaps/id/266" class="link">Miller Map</a>
               of about 1909 there is only one path coming from the direction of Badin. Notice the way in which the road
               curves.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">A second path shows up on the 1920 rural delivery map. I believe this road was built
               with the increase in automobile traffic.

               The <a href="http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/ncmaps/id/939" class="link">Rural Delivery
                  Map</a> of 1920 shows two paths branching off the Badin Road and heading south to the ferry road.

               We can see that the newer western most path is straighter, built for cars.
               A home site symbol shows up across from the western most junction with the Ferry Road.
               I believe this was later thought to be the school location.
               There is a symbol for a school location close to the junction of the old more eastern branch.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
               I believe that the Dickville School sat on a well known site. It has remained unidentified and unclaimed
               by any family. That site is near the pond. It is on the south side of the ferry road. It is just west of
               the spot where the fire road joins the ferry road. I believe I have found the foundation of the church
               mentioned by Mr. Mills. I have found stacked stone foundations on the river
               or east side of the fire road.
