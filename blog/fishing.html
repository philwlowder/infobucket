I. Earliest memory

Older memories are incomplete fragments of events.

My earliest memory is chewing on the rungs of my crib.
Gnawing the wood hurt so good and the taste was pleasing.
I wonder if lead paint was involved. If so, that might explain a lot.

I remember my father was holding me while he stood beside our refrigerator.
He held me against his chest with one arm under me. My face was close to his.
I don't remember my mother being near. He laughingly asked "Who do you like best,
your mother or me?" I thought about the answer to that question.

With more experience I could have replied, "I like you best! How about some ice cream?".
I thought if I choose one, the other will not be happy.
That direction seemed cruel and risky. It was my first dilemma involving relationships.
I didn't like it. I eventually replied "I like you both".

I don't have many memories of childhood.

In the late 1950s and into the 1960s, my mother's father kept his homemade boat at Morrow Mountain State Park.

His was not the only boat chained to trees on the bank.
The boats floated where the foot bridge now lands at its boat launch side.

He loaded his motor, fishing rods, fuel and other gear. Then he drove from Badin to the park using Falls road.
Before reaching Falls Reservoir he turned to the right on a road that took him into the park.
He turned right again and soon came to the park gate.

Most often there was rain water in the bottom of the boat.
To remove the water, he used a gallon Preston Anti Freeze can with the top removed
and a copper handle welded to it. I can remember the sound of the can as it ran along the
bottom of the wooden boat. Next he walked the motor to the stern and attached it.
When everything was loaded he started the motor by pulling its cord.
I can smell the gas and oil floating in the air.

The last time I made this fishing trip must have been when I was about 22.
It had been years since the last trip.
