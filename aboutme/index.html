         <h1>About Me</h1>

         <p class="paragraph">In 1950 I was born in Albemarle, NC.</p>

         <p class="paragraph"> At this point life became complicated and much more
            difficult. As I understand it, I laid around, hit the bottle, and put on
            weight. I never said a word. One of my best years evidently. After that first
            year, my parents took me kicking and screaming away from Albemarle. Many people
            feel I left as an infant only to return in 1994 as infantile. Such is life.
         </p>

         <p class="paragraph"> My father’s parents were both natives of Stanly County.
            Dad’s father, William P. Lowder, was born in what is now Morrow Mountain State
            Park. Will was the last owner/operator of the ferry that ran from Stanly County
            to near the mouth of the Uwharrie River. My mother’s parents moved here in the
            1920′s. Although she was born here, I have always felt Mom was an outsider and
            not really one of us. Her father worked for Alcoa, when he could take time off
            from hunting and fishing. From the time I was 5 until I was 15, we lived in
            Monroe, NC. In those years I spent many weekends and holidays visiting my
            grandparents. I was often dragged from a comfortable bed onto the river and
            into the boiling sun. There I sat in a smelly home made boat. I was unable to
            speak or I would scare the fish. My grandfather was catching the fish. Why
            would the fish be afraid of me? Why did he take me to the river if the fish
            feared me? </p>

         <p class="paragraph"> I graduated from Shelby High School in 1968 after
            attending for only a year and a half. Almost every other student went to Shelby
            High for 3 years. So, I was able to graduate in half the time. Statistics don’t
            lie. It hurt me not to be invited to speak at graduation. My accomplishments
            often go unnoticed. (Statistics don’t lie, but I should mention that I moved to
            Shelby half way into my Junior year.) Then I attended Western Carolina
            University graduating in 1972. After the lack of recognition in high school, I
            took 4 years to finish at WCU. Why knock yourself out? It was at Western
            Carolina that I concentrated my energy on chess. I focused like a weak
            flashlight. I can honestly claim that no school activities came between chess
            and me. Dedication like that should always be rewarded. I’m certain it would
            have been, if I had some talent for the game. </p>

         <p class="paragraph"> I’ve been taking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_pharmacology"
               class="link">lithium</a> since about 1981. It has helped manage my <a
               href="http://www.dbsalliance.org/site/PageServer?pagename=education_bipolar" class="link">bipolar
               disorder</a>. Take this opportunity to learn about mental
            illness. Two million adult Americans have some form of bipolar disorder. </p>

         <p class="paragraph"> While in Sumter, SC, I was a member of the ‘Sumter/Shaw
            PC Users Group’ from 1989 until 1992. (It was a computer club.) Those were the
            good old days of MS-DOS. My participation in that group has been my main
            computer education. </p>
