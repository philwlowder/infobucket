      <p class="paragraph">For several years I've allowed my website to stagnate. In
        early January I started to make changes. I moved my site to <abbr title="Amazon
Web Services">AWS</abbr> LightSail. I describe that in this <a href="/blog/015-vps.html">post</a>. </p>

      <p class="paragraph"> LightSail is wonderful, fast, inexpensive, but it's not
        free. I've been reading that all the cool kids were switching to static
        websites. There are several reasons, one reason is free hosting. Another reason
        is that static sites are fast. Finally and importantly, new tools have made
        multiple page static sites easier to manage than in the past. </p>

      <p class="paragraph"> When sites have more than a few pages they become
        difficult to manage. If a change needs to be made to every page, making those
        changes becomes tedious and time consuming. </p>

      <p class="paragraph"> I learned to use PHP include statements. By creating each
        page with PHP include statements, files with pieces of HTML can be inserted
        into every page. PHP enables the alteration of one file to be duplicated in
        many files. </p>

      <p class="paragraph"> There is a downside to the use of PHP include statements.
        Unless the page is cached, the server must take the time to run PHP include
        statements each time a page is requested by a browser. Today developers are
        using JavaScript tools to build each page before uploading to a live server.
        Static sites sit on the server fully built and ready to be served. </p>

      <p class="paragraph"> <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> is the JavaScript
        tool that I'm learning to use. Gulp plugins allow me to insert HTML as I did
        with PHP include statements. It also builds a finished CSS file from SCSS
        partial files. I hope to streamline the process as I learn from experience.
        With Gulp I can build a multi-page static site and manage it as well as with
        PHP. </p>

      <p class="paragraph"> I'm also using <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.
        I've experimented with Git and GitHub in the past. Git is version control
        software. I've always thought good backups where all I needed. I've learned
        that GitHub is an excellent replacement for <abbr title="File Transfer
Protocol">FTP</abbr> programs. I can change multiple files on my local computer
        and GitHub will track those changes until I'm ready to upload them to my
        server.</p>

      <p class="paragraph"> GitHub is a free host for static sites. Free is good, and
        it means I can archive sites with GitHub pages. They may remain after I am
        remains. I will not receive a bill in the afterlife. </p>

      <p class="paragraph"> This site is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and deploys from a
        private GitHub
        repository. Netlify has a free plan for static sites. </p>

      <p class="paragraph"> Those are behind the scene changes. A visitor will be
        unaware of them. If someone told you "blog" was an onomatopoeia, what would the
        word describe? I'm guessing something disgusting. For now I'm calling my post,
        commentaries. It sounds nicer. There a few older post that will be broken by
        the changes in this home page. I intend to work on that next. </p>

      <p class="paragraph"> I have tried to improve my image gallery. It now takes
        fewer clicks to crank up a slideshow with Lightbox. In the past I've used
        thumbnails. I liked the look, but they seemed without any function. The
        thumbnails are gone. I have many photos I could add to my gallery. I have so
        many choices, no direction, and it all takes time.
